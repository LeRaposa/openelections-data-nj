# 2011 Data Discrepancy

In the 18th district file for the November 8th general election downloaded from the state, the county total for Patrick J. Diegnan, Jr. in Middlesex County is 18,050.  However, if you add up the individual municipality totals, you only get 18,048.  Because of this, the formatted data files for the 2011 general election also show this difference and do not reconcile correctly.  Since I don't know which value is correct, and the result of the race is not impacted, I am not modifying any of the data.
