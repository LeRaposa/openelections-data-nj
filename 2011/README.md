# 2011 Data Discrepancy

In the 18th district file downloaded from the state, the county total for Middlesex County is 18,050.  However, if you add up the individual municipality totals, you only get 18,048.  Because of this, the formatted data files for the 2011 general election also show this difference and do not reconcile correctly.  Since I don't know which value is correct, I am not modifying any of the data.
